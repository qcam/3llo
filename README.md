3llo is the terminal client for Trello, which helps you manage Trello cards without
leaving your awesome terminal.

3llo was inspired by the awesome
[rainbowstream](https://github.com/DTVD/rainbowstream) and
[facy](https://github.com/huydx/facy).

## Why this named 3llo?

Good to know that `3 == "tre"` in Swedish.

## Installation

```ruby
gem install 3llo
```

You also need to have these environment variables set in your shell.

```
export TRELLO_USER=your_username
export TRELLO_KEY=your_key
export TRELLO_TOKEN=your_token
```

### Obtain Trello API key and token

1. Ensure you're logged into your Trello account at [trello.com](https://trello.com)
1. Visit [trello.com/app-key](https://trello.com/app-key), accept the Trello Developer Terms (if you're happy to do so) and press **Generate API Key**
1. Copy the `Key` that's displayed at the top of the page and set this as an environment variable (`TRELLO_KEY`).
1. Further down the page, follow the `Manually generate a token` link to generate a new API Token. Again, set this as an environment variable (`TRELLO_TOKEN`)
