3llo - The interactive CLI application for Trello
================

3llo allows you to work with Trello without exiting your favourite terminal.

3llo was inspired by the awesome
[rainbowstream](https://github.com/DTVD/rainbowstream) and
[facy](https://github.com/huydx/facy).

## Installation

```ruby
gem install 3llo
```

Run `3llo --configure` and follow the instructions to complete the set up.

## Usage

### "board" command family

Just like the web version of Trello, you need to select a board:

```
3llo  > board list

[123abc000000000000000001 #1] - Weekend TODOs
[123abc000000000000000002 #2] - 3llo project
[123abc000000000000000003 #3] - Grocery list

3llo > board select #2

Board Work stuff selected
```

Please note that you can also access any entities with their Trello ID.

```
3llo > board select 123abc000000000000000002

Board Work stuff selected
```

### "list" command family

Executing `list list` will list all the lists in the board.

```
3llo > list list

[123abc000000000000000001 #1] To Do
[123abc000000000000000002 #2] Doing
[123abc000000000000000003 #3] Pending
[123abc000000000000000004 #4] Done
```

`list cards <list_key>` will list all the cards.

```
3llo > list cards #1

[123abc000000000000000001 #1] Merge card editing command
[123abc000000000000000002 #2] Refactor code
...
```

### "card" command family

"card" command family comes with many commands to work with cards.

To list all the cards in the board, run `card list`.

```
3llo > card list

You can also list cards that have been assigned to you with `card list mine`.

### "3llo" sounds odd to me. Where did the name come from?

It might be interesting to know that `3 == "tre"` in Swedish ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª.
